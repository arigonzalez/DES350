	<div class="title">Dieter Rams: Ten Principles for Good Design</div>	

	
<div class="firstset">
<p>1: Good design is innovative </p>
	
		<p1>Technology is constantly and rapidly advancing. As a designer, I agree with Rams because I believe we should stay up to date with new programs and technologies that create new ways of thinking and designing. </p1>
	
	
<p>2: Good design makes a product useful </p>
	
<p1> I agree that the design of a product should have a purpose or goal, keeping in mind the needs of the audience. Good design shouldn't distract a viewer from that purpose. Design should be straightforward and should make the user's life easier, not more difficult. </p1>
	
<p>3: Good design in aesthetic </p>	
	
	I think the way a design looks matters because aesthetic can impact the the user's daily life and feelings, positively and negatively. I feel that designers have an obligation to make the world clear, but aesthetically appealing to everyone else.
	
	
<p>4: Good design makes a product understandable </p>	
	It is important to me that the design is straight to the point and doesn't confuse the viewer. The design should be precise, thoughtful, and communicate a clear and understandable message. If the design is not understandable, then it has failed as a design. 
	

<p>5: Good design is unobtrusive </p>	
I disagree with this principle. Sometimes graphic design needs to be loud and bold to get a point across. Personally, I think that large text or shapes and bright colors can further the message of a composition and make it distinct and noticeable. 
</div>
	
	
<div class="secondset">
<p>6: Good design is honest </p>
	
	Good design, to me, isn't manipulative, it is honest in its' delivery. Design should display the purpose or use straightforwardly, and it should not try <br>to portray itself as something it's not. I think there's a certain responsibility we have to design truthfully. 

<p>7: Good design is long-lasting </p>
	I agree that good design is timeless because it avoids being fashionable. It cannot become outdated. I agree that sticking with trends can make a piece look old or out-of-style. It's important to experiment and go outside the norm of your ideas and see where originality can take your design. 
	


<p>8: Good design is thorough down to the last detail </p>	
	
	Every last detail must be thought about in design. It is important to be accurate and careful when designing. I must be critical and thoughtful of every last aspect in order to satisfy a range of problems. Dieter Rams is correct when saying that being precise and thoughtful shows the designer has respect for their users.

<p>9: Good design is environmentally-friendly </p>
	Design makes the world a beautiful place, however, it should not congest or pollute the visual environment even further. If a design is bad, it's going to pollute visual space and create a negative reaction.
	

<p>10: Good design is as little design as possible </p>	
	
	I want to focus on the essentials and not overwhelming the audience. <br>I will try not to overdesign and focus more on simplicity.
